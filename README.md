# playListify-Backend
This is the backend for the my project [playListify](https://github.com/chetas411/playListify-Frontend)

## How it works
The code is written with reference to the [Spotify Web Api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). I am just making requests to the required endpoints and setting headers and all the parameters needed to get specific data as instructed in the API documentation. No external library is used to work with API, I have just followed the documentaion.
